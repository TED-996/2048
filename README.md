# 2048 with mistake prevention
This is a fork (mod) of the popular game [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) playable [here](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). This mod alerts you before you do a potentially dangerous move. The game assumes that you try to have the best tile in the lower-right corner and that values should be decreasing right-to-left on the last line. As a result, it will warn you when you try to move the tiles up (a very bad decision) or left (in case this move leaves empty the lower-right corner). Press Y to do the potentially dangerous move anyway and N (or any other movement keys) to cancel it.
